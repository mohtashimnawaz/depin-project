Design mockups and tokens for the DePIN Network frontend

Files:
- `mockups/low-fi-1.svg` — wireframe: centered hero, features row, quick stats
- `mockups/low-fi-2.svg` — wireframe: split hero (text + illustration)
- `mockups/hi-fi.svg` — high-fidelity homepage mockup in a minimal modern style
- `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` — recommended color palette, typography, spacing, and component tokens

Next steps:
1. Review the hi-fi mockup and approve or request changes.
2. Convert tokens into Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js`) and create base component styles.
3. Implement the design system components (`Button`, `Card`, `Hero`, spacing utilities) and replace hard-coded styles.

If you'd like, I can export hi-fi assets as PNGs and prepare a short Figma file (JSON export) or generate a Storybook story for the new components.
